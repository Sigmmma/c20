            This lets you pick the firing rate for this actor. Which affects
            firing behavior in the following ways:

            - Any above `0` rate of fire is limited by the referenced _weapon's_
              minimum _rounds per second_ as the actor will only tap the trigger
              not hold, not causing the firing speed to climb.

            - When set to `0`, the actor will hold the trigger causing it to use
            the
              weapon's windup behavior and allows it to reach the weapon's max firing rate.

            - If `0` and the weapon is a charging weapon the actor will hold the
            charge until
              the burst ends or the weapon's [overcharged action behavior](weapon#tag-field-triggers-charging-time) kicks in.

            - If not `0` charging the weapon will fire their uncharged
            projectiles if they have them.

            - Setting a number higher than the weapon's minimum rate of fire can
            prompt
              the actor to fire their gun slower than the weapon's minimum because it will
              try to tap fire at every `1/rate_of_fire` causing it to not be able to fire
              again immediately after the firing delay.

            The AI will not throw a grenade if another AI in the
            [encounter][scenario#encounters] threw one within this timeout. This
            prevents AI from all throwing grenades at the same time.

            determined by the _grenade type_ field. The actor will use up these
            grenades unless _has unlimited grenades_ is true. On death, the

            A random range for how loaded the dropped weapon is, as a fraction
            of its magazine size or charge. Plasma weapons are dropped at 100%
            charge no matter this field's value under special circumstances: *

            If non-zero, forces the bitmap index for any shader the biped uses.
            For example, the Elite major uses the value `1` which forces its
            shaders to use the second (red) cubemap in
            `characters\elite\bitmaps\cubemaps.bitmap`. [Bitmap tags][bitmap]
            which do not have a bitmap for this index will instead use the first
            map (index `0`).
