            The occlusion test square is moved towards the viewer by the
            _occlusion radius_. This avoids the test square being always half-embedded
            if the lens flare is placed directly on a surface.
            
            However, this offsets the test square perpendicularly toward the
            camera's view plane, not toward the camera location itself. This
            results in test squares near the edges of the screen not aligning
            with their lens flares, causing them to fade out even while on-screen.
            Avoid setting this value too high to make this less apparent.

            The test square is moved in the "forward" direction of the marker
            by the _occlusion radius_, usually off the surface in the case of
            [BSP lens flares](~scenario_structure_bsp#lens-flare-markers).

            If set, gives this lens flare a [Ray of Buddha](~h1/tags/lens_flare#ray-of-buddha)
            effect. This flag is already implied for any lens flare referenced by a
            [sky light](~tags/sky/#tag-field-lights) and does not need to be set,
            but this can be enabled for other types of lens flare usages.

            If enabled, skips checking if this lens flare is occluded. It will
            render regardless of any obstructions in the way like BSP. This also
            prevents flares like the sun from fading out when they go off-screen.

            Primarily controls the size of the camera-facing occlusion square.
            The more this square is covered, the more the lens flare fades out.
            A larger radius covers more screen space and gradually fades in/out
            while passing behind objects in the foreground, while a small radius
            will cause the lens flare to quickly appear or disappear. The square
            can be visualized with `rasterizer_lens_flares_occlusion_debug 1`.

            This also controls how far the test square is moved depending on the
            _occlusion offset direction_.

            This field also interacts with the _Ray of Buddha_ effect, controlling
            its radius when the _sun_ flag is set. However if this radius is set
            to exactly `50` then the _sun_ flag will be implied and _Ray of Buddha_
            will render too.

            Controls which direction the lens flare is offset. Ignored by the
            _Ray of Buddha_ effect if this tag's _sun_ flag is set, which always
            uses a _marker forward_ offset.

            The distance where the lens flare becomes invisible. Distance-based
            fading is disabled when set to `0`.

            Scales the lens flare's first reflection horizontally by this factor.
            Ignored and assumed `1` if this is set to `0`.
