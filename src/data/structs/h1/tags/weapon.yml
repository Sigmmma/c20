            Used for weapons like the oddball and flag which technically count
            as a third carried weapon, despite the game having a soft limit of 2
            held weapons (scripts and mods aside).

            Causes the weapon to explode using its [item][] _detonation effect_
            after being dropped. This is used to make the singleplayer fuel rod
            gun and energy sword explode when the enemies who carry them die.

            charging again as soon as it is fired potentially causing automatic

            This determines the maximum number of times this trigger can be
            fired per second.

            The first value is initial rate of fire and the second value is the
            final rate of fire.

            Weapons cannot fire faster than once per tick, and non-positive (0
            or less) rate of fire results in firing once per tick.

            Because weapons cannot fire in between ticks, fire rate is also
            effectively rounded down to the nearest tickrate/n for any positive
            integer n (so at 30 ticks per second: 30, 15, 10, 7.5, 6, 5, 4.288,
            3.75, 3.333, 3, etc.)

            This is the amount of ammo each trigger fire uses. Unless the "can
            fire with partial ammo" flag is set, the trigger cannot be fired if
            there is less than this much ammo remaining and will, instead,
            reload automatically. Firing with partial ammo with the partial ammo
            flag will result in the loaded ammo reaching 0 rather than a
            negative amount. A negative value results in the magazine gaining
            loaded rounds upon firing.

            Used for vehicle weapons to control the maximum angle of deviation
            when the aiming direction does not match the direction the weapon is
            facing. For example, the Ghost's deviation angle of 45 degrees
            allows the driver to fire in the direction they are aiming even if
            the Ghost has not yet turned to face that direction. Compare this to
            the Warthog gun's tighter 10 degree limit.

            **Unused**. This was meant to slow the player when using certain
            weapons like the rocket launcher, but it has no effect ingame
            regardless of the options, penalty values used, or game mode.
