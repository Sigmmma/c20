            The maximum distance to search for a shadow-casting surface from a
            surface being lit towards the sky light. The radiosity process
            shoots rays toward sky lights to determine if they are directly lit,
            but they can be limited with this field. If you are finding that
            distant parts of the BSP are not casting shadows where you expect,
            try increasing this. Increasing the distance likely has a time cost
            for radiosity since more surfaces need to be considered.

            The direction _toward_ the sky light from the origin. The _yaw_ is
            in a counterclockwise direction from the +X axis while the _pitch_
            ranges from `-90` (straight below) to `90` (straight above), with `0`
            being at the horizon.

            Angular diameter of the light source. It is entered in degrees in
            Guerilla but internally stored in radians. A wider angular diameter
            makes shadows softer. Increase this diameter if your light source is
            diffuse like as an overcast sky.

            Fully indoor maps where the sky isn't visible don't need to have a
            model since there would be no way to see it (and it doesn't render
            from indoor clusters anyway).

            [outdoor clusters][h1/tags/scenario_structure_bsp#indoor-vs-outdoor-clusters].
            It is like a fill light that approximates light coming from all
            directions and will be most visible in shadowed areas that would not
            be lit otherwise. This is typically a similar colour to the sky's
            backdrop, e.g. blue for a blue sky and black in space.

            Sets the strength of outdoor ambient light. Values around `0.2` are
            common. If this value is too high the level will appear flat
            and shapeless from a lack of strong shadows. This value must not be
            negative (causes a crash in pre-H1A versions).

            Limits the maximum density of outdoor fog. For example, a value of
            `0.75` would mean that no matter how far away parts of the level and
            objects are, the fog will only ever reach 75% opacity and you will
            still be able to see their textures and details faintly. If this
            value is `1` then distant areas beyond _outdoor_fog_opaque_distance_
            will always be _outdoor_fog_color_.

            Within this distance there will be no outdoor fog drawn. This is the
            start distance where fog begins to fade to its maximum density. A
            small value like `0` or `1` is typical.

            The distance where fog reaches its maximum density. Note that the
            _outdoor_fog_maximum_density_ may limit how opaque it actually is at
            this distance. For comparison, Blood Gulch's sky uses `100` while
            The Maw's uses `20`.

            This field is seemingly unused but was probably intended to allow
            indoor clusters to have a fog screen effect like planar [fog][h1/tags/fog].
            Setting a reference here does not cause anything to render even in H1A
            where fog screen effects were fixed for planar fog.

            A list of directional light sources that cast light on the level.
            These are mainly used to represent incoming sunlight, but you can
            include multiple lights to model different light sources. For
            example, if you were making a night sky with two moons you could
            have two lights, or if your sky is cloudy you may wish to have a
            direct overhead light with a high _diameter_ and low _power_ to
            model soft lighting bounced down from the clouds.

            A sky doesn't _have to_ have any lights. Indoor skies like the one
            for _The Library_ have no need unless you have a special reason to
            force directional lights indoors with the _affects interiors_ flag.
