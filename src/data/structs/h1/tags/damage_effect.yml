            If enabled, any headshot against an unshielded enemy will kill it
            regardless of the amount of damage inflicted. Even a 1-damage pistol
            still instantly kills a Hunter because of this flag. It is an
            instant kill even if the shield threshold is met with a headshot
            (after shields have been reduced to 0 by the damage effect but
            health is full). For example, even though the pistol deals 25 damage
            and players have 75 shield vitality, if the final shot is a headshot
            the player dies.

            Although there is also a _can cause multiplayer headshots_ flag, it
            has a separate meaning and this flag applies to both SP and MP.

            A model's headshot area is determined by its `head`
            [region][gbxmodel#regions].

            If enabled, causes the effect to trigger the explosion of dropped
            grenades within its radius, used for explosion chaining. This only
            applies to maps loaded in singleplayer mode. Note that the [item][]
            receiving damage (e.g. the grenade [equipment][]) must also have its
            _destroyed by explosions_ flag enabled. If the grenade has been
            placed within the scenario in Sapien, the _does accelerate_ flag
            will also need to be checked in the properties window.

            Applies a 2x damage multiplier to headshots in multiplayer (based on
            how the map was loaded, not scenario type). This multiplier stacks
            with material modifiers below, so for example a cyborg armor
            modifier of 2 with this flag enabled results in a 4x headshot damage
            modifier.

            A model's headshot area is determined by its `head`
            [region][gbxmodel#regions].

            The minimum radius determines the sphere in which damage is 100% of
            _damage upper bound_. Damage fades linearly to _damage lower bound_
            at the maximum radius. Outside the maximum radius, 0 damage is
            dealt. The _aoe core radius_ field does not affect this calculation.

            Controls how long camera shaking lasts. On PC, short camera shakes
            (0.05) get skipped occasionally at high FPS since this feature is
            still [tied to frame rate][renderer#pc-regressions]. This is fixed
            and interpolated by [Chimera][].

            Objects within this radius will be damaged regardless of
            obstructions in the [BSP][scenario_structure_bsp]. Outside this
            radius, there must be a line of sight between the effect and target.
            Contrary to the Guerilla tooltip, this field does not determine if
            the damage has an area of effect; see _radius_.
