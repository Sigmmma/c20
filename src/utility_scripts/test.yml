        Performs an [unsigned right shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Logical_shift)
        (also called logical or zero filling shift) of a value by the given bit count.
        All bits are moved to the right by a number of positions, with the leftmost

        Returns the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)
        (exclusive or) of two numbers. If a bit differs in both inputs, it is
