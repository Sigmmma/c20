The **Amalgam Scene Specification** (ASS) file format is a text-based intermediate representation of level geometry which can be compiled into tag formats using [H2](~h2-tool) and [H3 Tool](~h3-tool). It is the successor to [JMS](~) for level BSPs, though JMS is still supported past H1.

ASS is exported from 3D editors like [Blender](~) and [3ds Max](~3dsmax) using add-ons or converted from [MCC FBX](~fbx) using Tool.
