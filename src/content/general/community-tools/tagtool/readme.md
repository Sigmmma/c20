**TagTool** is a command-line tool designed to aid in the research and modification of Halo Online Cache Files. But is also Compatible with Halo 3, ODST and partial support for Halo Reach as well. 

* TagTool Functions very similarly to Tool, making it easy to learn if you have past experince with the Halo Editing Kit.
* Primarily designed for Halo Online, MS23 with partial support for higher versions.
* Map and tag formats may change over time as the game receives updates, meaning TagTool must be updated regularly.
* Mod tools and source tags are now available for most MCC titles, meaning it is easier than ever to port tags.
