* TagTool Functions very similarly to Tool, making it easy to learn if you have past experince with the Halo Editing Kit.
* Primarily designed for Halo Online, MS23 with partial support for higher versions.
* Map and tag formats may change over time as the game receives updates, meaning TagTool must be updated regularly.
* Mod tools and source tags are now available for most MCC titles, meaning it is easier than ever to port tags.
