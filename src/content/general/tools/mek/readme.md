The **Mozz Editing Kit**, previously called the **Moses Editing Kit** or **Mo's Editing Kit** (MEK), is an [open source][mek-repo] and cross-platform Python-based toolset which offers alternatives to and supplements the tools of the [HEK](~). It is primarily focused on Halo Custom Edition and has no support for H1A (MCC).

The MEK was originally created by MosesOfEgypt and was maintained by [Sigmmma][] afterwards.

{% alert type="danger" %}
The MEK project is no longer maintained, so use it at your own risk. Although it has power-user features that save time compared to using the HEK, some its its features are buggy. If you are experiencing difficulties using the MEK's tools, consider using alternatives like [Invader](~) or the updated [H1A-EK](~) for MCC.
