**Halo 4** is the fifth instalment of the Halo game series and is a direct sequel to [Halo 3](~h3). It was created by [343 Industries][343i] and initially released on the Xbox 360 in November 2012 by publisher/owner [Microsoft][]. In 2020 the game was re-released as a part of *Halo: The Master Chief Collection* on the Xbox One and Microsoft Windows.

Like other games in the series Halo 4 uses Bungie/343i's proprietary [Blam!](~blam) with a multitude of upgrades over the Halo Reach version of the engine.

## Xbox (343i, November 2012)
This is the classic first release of Halo 4 for the Xbox 360.

### Modding
There are several tools and mods for the base game or external programs that users can grab to enhance their experience. Examples include:

* [Assembly](~assembly) - A cache editing tool for various titles in the Halo series. Users can use this tool to make permanent edits to cache files and poke changes in real time. While not traditional workflow for map creation, it is a powerful tool that can be used to create interesting experiences. 
* [TagTool](~tagtool) - A cache editing tool designed to allow *porting* of tag data between different versions and builds of the Blam engine, as well as importing brand new content.

Like all Halo games [tags](~) play a large role in modding.

## MCC (PC and Xbox One, 343 Industries, 2019-Current day)
Halo: The Master Chief collection (MCC) is actively maintained by [343 Industries][343i] for both PC and Xbox One. It brings the Halo series under a single [Game as a Service][gaas], including unified matchmaking and progression experiences. The PC port uses [Unreal Engine][unreal] as a menu and input layer over the respective engines of each included Halo game.

In 2020, Halo Reach was re-released for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows as part of the Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Often called **H4 MCC** by the community.

### Modding
There are several tools and mods for the base game or external programs that users can grab to enhance their experience. Examples include:

* [Halo 4 Editing Kit](~h4-ek) - The official editing suite released for the MCC version of Halo 4 largely based on internal tools developed by Bungie and later used by 343 Industries and [Saber Interactive][saber]. Some changes were made to make the tools more user friendly and stable, as well as to support importing content from modern 3D modeling software.
* [Foundry](https://github.com/ILoveAGoodCrisp/Foundry-Halo-Blender-Creation-Kit) - A collection of tools for Blender that handles the entire export/import pipeline from Blender to the H4 engine.
* [Assembly](~assembly) - A cache editing tool for various titles in the Halo series. Users can use this tool to make permanent edits to cache files and poke changes in real time.
