**Projectiles** are a type of object fired from [weapons](~weapon) or thrown as grenades that interact with objects or map geometry. Through their parent [object](~) tag they can reference a [model](~) so they may have a visual element and/or a collision box. Projectiles have many properties and can interact with any material specified in the [globals](~) in various ways like bouncing or detonating.

# Movement

Projectile movement is simulated during each game tick (smallest unit of simulated time). According to the projectile's velocity and gravity scale, its next position is calculated by the engine and a "trace" ray between the two points is tested for collisions.

The trace collision test takes advantage of other objects' bounding radii and the collision BSP structures found in [collision models](~collision_model) and [scenario structure bsps](~scenario_structure_bsp). If any collision is detected, it is handled accordingly (e.g. applying effects, damage or playing sound).

If no collision is detected, the projectile is moved to its next position at the end of the trace line. The process continues, tick by tick, until the projectile collides or detonates at its maximum range.

A projectile with sufficiently high velocity behaves like a hitscan, since it will be able to cross a playable space within a single tick, with the game being simulated at 60 ticks per second. Should the projectile not be fast enough to hitscan the playable space, leading on targets may be required.

Projectiles receive a boost to the distance hitscanned on their spawn tick, this boost is very strong at low velocities such as 2, but as velocity increases the boost is reduced until it becomes negligible, like at 700.

Projectile vectors can be changed from all sources of [damage](~damage_effect) when a [collision model](~collision_model) is present by using the "instantaneous acceleration" value, this includes melee, explosions, normal rounds, and other projectiles colliding mid-air. When no collision is present only area of effect damage can effect projectiles

Introduced in H2, the "travels instantaneously" flag is used extensively by many weapons and makes projectiles reach short range targets in a much smaller amount of time, requiring less leading.


# Flags

These are general purpose flags that change the behavior of the projectile, more specific flags for individual parts of the projectile can be found further down in their specific section. This section also contains properties related to projectile detonation behavior.

| Weapon flags | Description
|-------|----------
| oriented along velocity | Orientation of projectile and it's attached [effects](~effect) so they match the direction it is moving, **needed for proper and consistent bouncing behavior**

| has super combining explosion | Enables supercombine functions on the projectile when attaching to targets
| damage scales based on distance | Causes the **impact** damage to be scaled by the "air damage range" bounds values, needs more research

| AI minor tracking threat | Used in conjunction with the [AI](~character) tag to allow AI to react to this projectile via diving and dodging away from projectiles

# Physics

This section defines the general properties about the projectile and how it travels to its target

{% alert %}
AI velocity scale is broken and **does not** scale the velocity of projectiles down below 1, however AI targeting and leading still acts as if it is and as such AI will overlead targets and miss: **scales above 1 work as intended**

**Forwards and backwards momentum from the player will be added onto the projectiles default velocity vector** (positive or negative). However projectiles cannot inherit momentum that results in backward motion when their velocity is a positive value or 0. **Only projectiles with a negative velocity can inherit momentum to move in both vectors**

# Material Responses

{% alert %}
Projectiles moving **faster than** 1499 WU/s are unable to attach under any conditions and will detonate instead when making contact with target
{% /alert %}

This section defines how the projectile reacts when it comes into contact with specific materials

| Default response | Data type | Description
|-------|----------|--------------
| impact (detonate) | enum | Projectile is deleted when it comes into direct contact with the material
| fizzle | enum | Appears to behave the same as impact
| overpenetrate | enum | Projectile passes through through this material but only on objects and **not** map geometry
| attach | enum | Projectile attaches to specified material, waiting the duration of the "timer" value in the detonation section
| bounce | enum | Projectile bounces off of the specified material, bounce properties are specified further below
| bounce (dud) | enum | Same as above, but the projectile no longer deals impact damage after the bounce, will steal deal detonation damage.
| fizzle (bounce) | enum | 

material name (string): string name of the material you are specifying the behavior for, materials are specified in the [globals](~)

potential response (enum): Same as the default response, but is the first place the game checks on projectile collision, if all conditions fail for potential, use default

| Response flags | Description
|-------|----------
| only against units (except giants) | Run potential response if velocity and angle conditions pass when making contact with [bipeds](~biped) or [vehicles](~vehicle)
| never against units (except giants) | Never run potential response if projectile makes contact with [bipeds](~biped) or [vehicles](~vehicle)

| between | bounds | A set of values that determines at what impact angle the projectile must meet to continue with the "potential response", 0 being parallel and 90 being perpendicular, else use "default response"
| and | bounds | A set of values that determines at what speed the projectile needs to be traveling at when it makes contact to continue with the "potential response", else use "default response"

## Misc, penetration and reflection

{% alert %}
Parallel and perpendicular friction act as a bounds where the closer to impact angle 0 a projectile makes contact, the closer it's velocity fraction lost gets to the "parallel friction" value, and vice versa with impact angles closer to 90 causing the velocity fraction lost to skew closer to the "perpendicular friction" value
{% /alert %}

{% /figure %}

{% figure src="distribution1.2.jpg" %}
Pictured: Now with the distribution exponent set to 1.2 with no other changes

{% alert %}
Conical spread only works when the "travels instantaneously" flag is enabled and a value other than 0 is set for "maximum range"
{% /alert %}

This section can be used for weapons that fire a high volume of projectiles in a single shot, like shotguns: it defines the spread of the entire blast and the distribution of shots within the blast to allow more variability (how tight the grouping can be) compared to the error fields in the [weapon](~weapon#error-spread-bloom) tag
