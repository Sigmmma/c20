**Weapons** are most commonly seen as the wieldable items dropped by AI and found in the environment. However, they are also used for items like the CTF flag, oddball, and weapons attached to [vehicles](~vehicle) or [bipeds](~biped). 

Weapons are intended to fire instances of the [projectile](~) tag or [crate](~) tag. Thrown grenades are not a type of weapon, but rather a [projectile referenced by globals](~globals).

Weapons through their parent [object](~) tag can be assigned a [render mesh](~render_model), [collision box](~collision_model), [animation set](~model_animation_graph) and [physics shape](~physics_model). 

# Flags

These are general purpose flags that change the behavior of the weapon, more specific flags for individual parts of the weapon can be found further down in their specific section.

| Weapon flags | Description
|-------|----------
| must be readied | Prevents weapon from being used, attempting to attack with weapon will force drop it.
| doesn't count towards maximum | Allows weapon to become a third or fourth weapon for the player
| aim assists only when zoomed | Disables bullet magnetism and red reticle when unzoomed
| prevents grenade throwing | Prevents grenade throwing while weapon is equiped and held, unknown else behavior
| prevents melee attack | Disables melee attacks with weapon
| detonates when dropped | When this weapon is not being held by a unit or model it explodes, uses the parent [item](~) tag for detonation values and references
| cannot fire at max age | Causes weapon to be unable to be fired once it reaches max age
| secondary trigger overrides grenades | If the secondary trigger key is also bound to grenade throw, this flag forces no grenade throw
| support weapon | Removes grenade and equipment chud icons, causes weapon to be dropped when a melee attack is performed and disables grenade throwing
| AIs use melee damage | Causes AI characters to use the melee damage of the weapon instead of their biped melee damage value
| forces no binoculars | Disables binoculars on weapon, binoculars are separate from weapon zoom

# Heat

This section is responsible for various properties and responses to weapon heat, generally weapons without the need to reload have a heat system to normalize their output.

{% alert %}
- For values of 0 to 1 these represent percentages, so 0.2 = 20%

- Heat gained while firing the weapon is handled by the weapon [barrel](~weapon#misc-and-recoil) being fired

| player melee response | [damage_effect](~) / [damage_response_definition](~) | Unknown/Needs additional research

# Melee

Melee attacks for the player are not natural to the player unit themself, but rather the weapon they hold. With this we can set different weapons to deal different amounts and types of melee damage: this section contains the references for such [damage_effect]() tags.

| Melee damage parameters | Data type | Description
|-------|----------|--------------
| damage pyramid angles | euler | Two values that define the angles the melee attack is thrown out/Needs additional research

# Weapon aim assist

{% alert %}
For **melee** weapons the lunge range is set as the autoaim range & falloff range, lunge range however is *effectively* capped at a value of 5.2 for the autoaim fields, past this the lunge is either disabled or is inconsistent
{% /alert %}

This section defines weapon assist features to make target aquisition easier, especially for controller. **autoaim** is more commonly known as *bullet magnetism* and is where your projectiles deviate towards targets without input from the player, making the ability to hit targets easier. **magnetism** is more commonly known as *aim assist* where your reticle is gently pulled onto targets without player input, this makes target aquisition and tracking much easier.

| deviation angle | angle | Funtions the same as "autoaim angle", but ignores the ["strict deviation angle" weapon flag](~weapon#flags)

# Movement

This section is responsible for movement **penalty** properties, slowing the players movement under certain conditions.

{% alert %}
Movement penalty values work as percentages in increments of 0.1, incorrect values will be rounded down
(example: 0.28 = 28% movement speed penalty but this will be rounded down to 0.2 or 20%)
{% /alert %}

| Behavior | Description
|-------|----------
| spew |When trigger is pressed the weapon will continuously fire the barrel, under normal circumstances will fire in bursts of 2
| latch | When pressed the barrel is fired and then halts until the trigger is let go and repressed
| latch-autofire | Functions like latch until the trigger is held down for the period of time specified in **autofire time**, then begins charging and will fire once the trigger is released
| charge | Appears to function similar to latch-autofire, but better suited to weapons with a single barrel for charging behavior only
| latch-zoom | Same as latch but allows a second barrel to be used when the weapon is zoomed
| latch-rocketlauncher | Same as latch but is needed to also allow target locking onto human tracked targets by holding the trigger on the target and then releasing the trigger to fire once locked on
| spew-charge | Functions like spew for a period of time specified in charging time before charging the second barrel
| sword-charge | Unknown, seems to function like latch-autofire but triggers a melee while releasing the charge

# Barrels

Triggers are tied to barrels, barrels themselves are the most important part of the weapon. This section contains flags related to the properties of the current barrel and the projectiles spawned from it. 

| Flags | Description
|-------|----------
| tracks fired projectile | Allows projectiles to track targets on weapons used by the player, AI seem to ignore this flags presence
| random firing effects | Unknown/Needs additional research
| can fire with partial ammo | Normally when a weapon does not have enough ammo in the magazine to fulfill a barrel fire, the weapon will force reload, this flag allows the weapon to still be used and fire the normal number of shots regardless of incomplete ammo requirement
| projectiles use weapon origin | Only applicable to players, causes weapon to fire projectiles from the third person weapon trigger markers, rather than the player camera
| ejects during chamber | Unknown/Unused/Causes 3rd person shotgun ejection port to not open after chambering
| use error when unzoomed | Causes barrel error values to only be applied when not zoomed with the weapon, zero error when zoomed
| projectile vector cannot be adjusted | Forces projectiles to emit from the 3rd person weapon trigger marker, in the exact direction the marker is pointing, regardless of player aim or bullet magnetism. Also disables all weapon projectile tracking for all users.
| projectiles have identical error | Unknown/Needs additional research
| projectiles fire parallel | Unknown/Needs additional research
| can't fire when others firing | Presumably prevents this barrel from firing while another barrel is firing
| can't fire when others recovering | Prevents this barrel from firing while another barrel is still recovering with its fire recovery time
| don't clear fire bit after recovering | Enabling this flag disallows soft recovery fraction for latch weapons while also disabling the ability for spew weapons to use the value of **1** for "shots per fire"
| staggers fire across multiple markers | Causes weapon to cycle projectile emission point from multiple trigger markers, alternates between 2 markers but for more than 2 markers it seems to pick at random
| fires locked projectiles | Forces AI actors using this barrel to only track when targeting a human-tracking type unit, else they self-guide projectiles, unknown otherwise
| can fire at maximum age | This barrel will continue to be able to fire despite the weapon age being at 0
| use 1 firing effect per burst | Weapon will only play it's firing effect a single time, all shots after either in a burst or spew will not have a firing effect
| ignore tracked object | Unknown/Needs additional research

## Firing

Defines **how** the current barrel fires.

| Fields | Data type | Description
|-------|----------|--------------
| rounds per second | real | Two values that determine the rate at which projectiles are fired when in spew or during a burst, invalid values are rounded down to nearest valid in gameplay, **values under 10 for weapons with an entry >1 in the "shots per fire" field do not sync in multiplayer correctly**
| acceleration time | real | Time taken in seconds for the weapon to transition the rounds per second value from the first value to the last value at a constant rate of value change once the weapon starts firing (rate of fire itself may not change due to invalid values but they are still used to fill time)
| deacceleration time | real | Time taken in seconds for the weapon to transition the rounds per second value from the last value to the first value at a constant rate of value change once the weapon stops firing (rate of fire itself may not change due to invalid values but they are still used to fill time)
| barrel spin scale | real | Scales the "barrel_spin" function by a mutiplicative value from 0 to 1, 0 is equal to 1 as the barrel fires
| blurred rate of fire | real | Unknown/Needs additional research
| shots per fire | short | The number of shots produced when this weapon is fired, spew weapons normally use a value of 0, but the trigger type forces them to fire 2 times
| fire recovery time | real | Value in seconds that defines how long the weapon must wait after firing a shot before another shot can be fired, adheres to limitations based on tick rate so some values may not work and will round up to nearest correct value
| soft recovery fraction | real | A value from 0 to 1 that defines how much of the fire recovery time you can input a fire request and the game saves and plays it when the fire recovery ends, even if the player has stopped the fire request input
| magazine | index | This selection is a dropdown that gives a selection of magazine blocks opened to be used for rounds per fire: NONE, Primary and Secondary
| rounds per shot | short | The number of rounds to be expended from the associated magazine by this barrel when fired
| minimum rounds loaded | short | The number of rounds needed to fire this weapon, after firing the weapon and going below this value a reload is forced, ignores firing with partial ammo flag
| rounds between tracers | short | Value that feeds into a projectile function called "tracer" that sets the function to zero for the duration of the number of shots of the value found here (A value here of 1 means the tracer function turns fully on and then fully off after every shot)
| optional barrel marker name | string | Overrides the default trigger marker name with whatever is entered here to use as the barrel marker for projectile origin (when not being fired from player or biped camera)

## Weapon firerate bonus info

{% figure src="rps-frt.png" %}
Pictured: An example of rate of fire and fire recovery time
{% /figure %}

When using the __rounds per second__ field in the weapons barrel block, you are given a set of 2 bound values to enter, due to limitations implemented by 343 to retain 30 tick engine behavior you may only enter values compatible with 30 tick engines. __0.46875 is the lowest possible value allowed__ due to the idle_ticks timer only allowing a max of 127 ticks, thus this value has the weapon fire on the 128th tick. __To find all other compatible values, do 30 divided by a *whole* number between 1 and 64.__ Invalid values will round *down* to the nearest valid (Example: 16 will behave as 15).

When using the __fire recovery time__ field in the weapons barrel block, you are given a single value (in seconds) to enter, this value is able to accept 60 tick engine values, there is a built-in 2 tick base delay *plus* a second minimum delay of 2 ticks so the __fastest possible rate of fire achievable with fire recovery time is 12 rounds per second__ with a value of 0.

## Prediction and noise

| damage error | real | A set of two values that determines firing error when the [model](~) tag for this weapon is in a damage state with the flag that damages primary/secondary weapon enabled, chooses randomly between the 2 values: **this is not normal weapon error, that is located further down**
| min error look pitch rate | angle | The max rate of aiming/looking allowed when this weapon is at minimum error (130 is referenced as full power)
| full error look pitch rate | angle | The max rate of aiming/looking allowed when this weapon is at maximum error (130 is referenced as full power)

| acceleration time | real | Time in seconds taken for the weapon to go from minimum error and min error pitch rate to maximum error and full error pitch rate when the weapon starts firing (dual wield only)
| deacceleration time | real | Time in seconds taken for the weapon to go from maximum error and full error pitch rate to minimum error and min error pitch rate when the weapon stops firing (dual wield only)
| minimum error | angle | The minimum error this weapon is allowed to have when dual wielded, will never have less than this amount of error under any condition (dual wield only)
| error angle | angle | Two bound values that determine weapon error, first value is upon first firing and second value is after the acceleration time has passed, will return to first value during deacceleration time (dual wield only)
| dual wield damage scale | real | From 0 to 1, determines the damage done by this weapon when being fired as part of dual wield, 0 equals 1 (0.1 equals 10% of full normal damage)

| Distribution function | Description
|-------|----------
| point | Projectile spread is offset from the exact crosshair point, around it, typical weapon spread/bloom behavior and uses projectiles per shot and error values
| horizontal fan | Uses projectiles per shot and distribution angle to fan out projectiles in either a horizontal fan or a vertical fan, fan direction is based on where the biped is aiming

| Fields | Data types | Description
|-------|----------|--------------
| projectiles per shot | short | Number of projectiles fired at the exact same moment
| distribution angle | real | Requires fan distribution function and projectiles per shot to be above 1, sets how wide the fans are (values above 1 tend to spray the fans so far they end up behind the biped)
| minimum error | angle | The minimum error this weapon is allowed to have when dual wielded, will never have less than this amount of error under any condition (single wield only)
| error angle | angle | Two bound values that determine weapon error, first value is upon first firing and second value is after the acceleration time has passed, will return to first value during deacceleration time (single wield only), both values function as a "0 degrees to X degrees" rather than using both values and choosing between them at random

{% alert %}
This has a dropdown for 3 different block entries: single wield, dual right and dual left
{% /alert %}
 
| First person offset | 3 different value entries for coordinates away from the player camera in which projectiles will deviate from as their origin point
|-------|----------
| **X** | with positive being forward from the camera 
| **Y** | with positive being up on the vertical axis 
| **Z** | with positive being to the left on the horizontal axis

## Projectile

What good is a gun if it shoots nothing? this section defines **what** the weapon fires.

| Fields | Tags/data types | Description

| damage effect reporting type | enum | Dropdown selector for various weapon and vehicle types, unknown/unused effects
| projectile | [projectile](~) | Projectile tag fired from the weapon when the weapon is fired
| optional secondary projectile | [projectile](~) | Projectile tag fired from the weapon when the weapon is fired: when a spew weapon or burst fire weapon is fired, all projectiles after the first (or first two with spew) become the secondary projectile
| damage effect | [damage_effect](~) | The damage created at the projectile origin point, use damage effects with an area of effect for best result, does not hurt the entity firing the weapon
| crate projectile | [crate](~) | Causes the weapon to fire this crate tag object when the weapon fires from a firing action, uses the velocity of the value below
| crate projectile speed | real | The velocity in WU at which the crate projectile is fired out

## Misc and recoil

This section contains a mix-match of properties for the current barrel, including how much **heat** it generates when fired and recoil.


| Fields | Data types | Description
|-------|----------|--------------
| ejection port recovery time | real | Unknown/Needs additional research
| illumination recovery time | real | How long in seconds it takes for the "illumination" function to transition from 1 to 0 after a shot has been fired
| heat generated per round | real | The amount of heat added to the weapon when it has been fired, per shot
| age generated per round | real | The age amount deducted from a weapon when it has been fired, from 100%
| campaign age generated per round | real | The age amount deducted from a weapon when it has been fired, from 100%, for campaign only
| overload time | real | Unknown/needs additional research
| angle shot per shot | angle | Two value entries that define how much recoil the weapon experiences when it is fired, transitions from the first value to the second value through acceleration when firing and deacceleration when not firing
| acceleration time | real | Time taken when you begin firing the weapon to transition from min angle to max angle per shot
| deacceleration time | real | Time taken when you stop firing the weapon to transition from max angle to min angle per shot
| angle change function | short | Dropdown with variety of options that detail how the function transitions the recoil from min to max during acceleration

## Firing effects

Generally when a weapon fires it produces a flash and smoke at the end of the barrel, this is where you can define those [effects](~effect)

| Firing effects | Tag/data type | Description
|-------|----------|--------------
| shot count lower bound | short | Unknown/needs additional research
| shot count upper bound | short | Unknown/needs additional research
| firing effect | [sound](~) / [effect](~) | The sound or effect played on the weapon when it is firing
| misfire effect | [sound](~) / [effect](~) | The sound or effect played on the weapon when it is firing
| empty effect | [sound](~) / [effect](~) | The sound or effect played on the weapon when it is firing but has no ammunition
| optional secondary firing effect | [sound](~) / [effect](~) | Unknown/requires additional research
| firing damage | [damage_effect](~) / [damage_response_definition](~) | The damage or damage response played on the player firing the current weapon
| misfire damage | [damage_effect](~) / [damage_response_definition](~) | Unknown/requires additional research
| empty damage | [damage_effect] / [damage_response_definition](~) | Unknown/requires additional research
| optional secondary firing damage | [damage_effect](~) / [damage_response_definition](~) | Unknown/requires additional research
| firing rider damage | [damage_effect](~) / [damage_response_definition](~) | The damage or damage response played on other vehicle rider players when the gunner player fires the current weapon
| misfire rider damage | [damage_effect](~) / [damage_response_definition](~) | Unknown/requires additional research
