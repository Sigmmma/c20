Welcome to **The Reclaimers Library** (**c20**), a project which aims to document and centralize the immense tribal knowledge of the [Halo: Combat Evolved](~h1) modding community, and to a lesser extent the modding communities that developed around the later Halo titles. This is an unofficial resource by modders, for modders.

_Modding_ is the modification of a game by its fans in order to change existing content, add new content, or implement unofficial bug fixes and game features. Halo 1 has a strong tradition of modding starting from Xbox, moving to PC with Custom Edition, and continuing today with H1A for MCC.

# Why mod Halo?
Halo's 2001 engine is not as generalized as _Unity_, _Source_, _Creation Engine_, and _Unreal_, but this is actually a strength. Halo provides all the foundational game systems of a sandbox shooter, yet these systems are highly data-driven by [_tag_ assets](~h1/tags) which you create. No coding required!

Dip your toes in with simple modifications to existing maps, or build a complete custom content overhaul. The relative simplicity of Halo's assets means a lower barrier to entry.

Perhaps the best part is connecting with other creative, passionate fans. Knowledge sharing and collaborative work are staples of this community.

# Getting started
We cover [engine details](~h1/engine), the legacy 2003 [Halo Editing Kit](~hek) and its 2021 re-release the [H1A Editing Kit](~h1a-ek), community tools, and [guides](~) for custom content creation.

Less in-depth but we hope still useful information is included for the legacy 2007 [Halo 2 Vista Editing Kit](~h2v-ek), its 2021 MCC re-release the [Halo 2 Editing Kit](~h2-ek) as well as the [Halo 3 Editing Kit](~h3-ek) that was first publicly released in 2021.
