Welcome to **The Reclaimers Library** (**c20**), a project which aims to document and centralize the immense tribal knowledge of the Halo modding community. This is an unofficial resource by modders, for modders, covering Halo Custom Edition and the new MCC [mod tools](~general/mod-tools) for all titles.

_Mods_ are fan-made modifications to a game that change or add content, or implement unofficial bug fixes and new features. Halo has a 20+ year tradition of modding which is still going strong. On c20 we focus on today's best practices and tools.

Everyone makes mods for different reasons; maybe it's to rebalance the sandbox, learn new skills, expand on a favourite game, or curiosity about how the game works. Regardless, we hope this resource can help you.

**This website is always a work in progress!** We especially need more information beyond Halo CE. Please [contribute info](~contributing) if you can.
