**Halo 2 Guerilla** can refer to both:
* [H2 Guerilla (2021)][h2-guerilla] a part of the MCC [Halo 2 Mod Tools][h2-ek]
* or Legacy [H2V Guerilla (2007)][h2v-guerilla] for the [Halo 2 Vista Editing Kit][h2v-ek] (H2V-EK)

If you are new to Halo 2 modding you likely are looking for the former and not the later.
