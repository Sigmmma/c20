This is an article about the H2 Tool for use with MCC. For the legacy H2V Tool for [Halo 2 Vista](~h2) see [H2V Tool](~h2v-tool).
{% /alert %}

**H2-Tool** (**tool.exe**), is a [command-line](~) utility used to compile data into [tags](~), and tags into [maps](~map). It was released as a part of the [Halo 2 Editing Kit](~H2-EK) by 343 Industries in 2021.

This new version of Tool has many differences from the 2007 Pi Studios Tool. Most notably, it includes far more verbs and new options for existing ones. A major addition is the FBX to ASS/JMS/JMA/JMI toolchain to compile models regardless of what 3D modeling software you use.

# Conventions used in this article

- `<arg>` - refers to a mandatory argument.
- `[arg]` - refers to an optional argument (you can omit these).
- parentheses appended to the `arg` name are used to encode valid argument values.
- `arg(option1, option2)` - Either `option1` or `option2` can be passed as `arg`.
- `arg(optionClass)` - Any value of `optionClass` can be used.
- `Tool` or `tool.exe` - refers to the subject of this article, the H2 Tool, if the legacy Tool is being referred to that will be made explicit.

# Command line flags
- `-data_dir` and `-tags_dir` can be used to change the data and tag directories respectively. This might not work with all verbs as it's experimental. See [using custom content paths](~mod-tools#using-custom-content-paths).
- `-pause` wait for user input before exiting, useful for custom launchers.

# Batch bitmap compilation
[TIFF][wiki-tiff] (.tif/.tiff) images can be compiled into a [bitmap](~) using the `bitmaps` verb:

```sh
# bitmaps <source-directory> [type] [debug-plate?]
tool bitmaps "scenarios\bitmaps\solo\spacestation"
```

* source-directory - A local data path to a folder containing a set of images for processing.
* type - sets the type of bitmap the image will be converted to. This will change how the source image is expected to be setup. The list of valid options is as follows:
	* *2d*
	* *3d*
	* *cubemaps*
	* *sprites*
	* *interface*
* debug-plate - Set this with a true or false. Dumps the processed image back to your data folder so that you may examine it in your preferred image editor. The path for these will be something like this.
	* data\bitmap-debug\

For the example above, Tool would expect to find .tif/.tiff files at `data\scenarios\bitmaps\solo\spacestation\`. Assuming no errors, each image file will be compiled into a bitmap tag at `tags\scenarios\bitmaps\solo\spacestation\`. Each image file that exists in the source directory will be compiled into its own individual tag with the name of the tag coming from the image filename.

Tool supports TIFF files with a [colour depth][wiki-color] of at least 8 bits per pixel, 32-bit color (8 bits per channel) being typical.

# Build cache file
A [scenario](~) can be compiled into a [map](~) using the `build-cache-file` verb. Simply provide your scenario's tag path. (the last two arguments are optional):

```sh
#  build-cache-file <scenario> [platform] [flags]
tool build-cache-file "scenarios\multi\example\example" dx11_64 compress|resource_sharing
tool build-cache-file "scenarios\multi\example\example" dx11_64 compress|resource_sharing
```

* scenario - A local tag path to your scenario without the file extension
* platform - Sets the platform the cache file is intended for. The default platform used and the only valid platform for MCC is as follows:
	* win64_dx11
* flags - A set of flags that can be used to toggle certain settings during cache complication. The options are as follows.
	* compress - If this string is present then the cache file will be compressed
	* resource_sharing - If this string is present then raw tag data, such as bitmap plate data, use shared maps for their data
	* mp_tag_sharing - If this string is present then tags will use shared maps for their data
	* multilingual_sounds  - If this string is present then the cache file will support and include multiple languages for sounds
	* remastered_support  - If this string is present then the cache file will support Saber3D

The resulting map file can be found in the editing kit's `h2_maps_win64_dx11` directory. This verb also generates reports under `reports\<mapname>` including a compilation-specific `debug.txt`.


# Build noise map
This command generates random noise like you would see in an image editor. The result can then be converted into a bitmap tag or taken to your image editing software to tweak further.

```sh
#  build-noise-map <tiff-file> <width> <height> <low-freq-skip> <high-freq-skip> <roughness> <blur-passes> <random-seed>
tool build-noise-map bitmap_test\256x256_20001_noise.tif 256 256 2 0 0 0 1
```

* tiff-file - A local data path to where the generated tiff will be placed. Make sure to include filename and extension.
* width - The width of the image with a max range of 16-4096. Value should be a power of 2 dimension
* height - The height of the image with a max range of 16-4096. Value should be a power of 2 dimension
* low-freq-skip - Low-frequency "octaves" to skip. A higher value means more noise
* high-freq-skip - High-frequency "octaves" to skip. A higher value more blur
* roughness - How smooth or rough the image is with a range of 0.0-1.0. With 0.0 being the smoothest image possible and 1.0 being the roughest image possible.
* blur-passes - The number of times to apply a blur pass.
* random-seed - A random seed for noise.

The resulting can be found in the `data` folder with the path you set in tiff-file.

# Bulk imports
Bulk import commands allow you to import many files at once using a JMI file. Other than that they work similarly to individual imports.

## Bulk collision
Multiple directories can have their collision files compiled in a single run using this command.

```sh
#  bulk-collision <jmi-file>
tool bulk-collision "objects\multi\jmi_Test.JMI"
```

* jmi-file - A local data path to where the JMI file is located.

## Bulk import crates
Compile multiple source directories in a single run to generate a crate tag and all the relevant tags involved.

```sh
#  bulk-import-crates <jmi-file>
tool bulk-import-crates "objects\multi\jmi_Test.JMI"
```

* jmi-file - A local data path to where the JMI file is located.

## Bulk import crates folder
Generates a crate tag and compiles the render, collision, and physics directory of a model in a single run. Just point it at the root of your model folder and go!

```sh
#  bulk-import-crates-folder <source-directory>
tool bulk-import-crates-folder "objects\multi\world_node_a"
```

* source-directory - A local data path to the root of a model source directory.

## Bulk import model folder
Generates a model tag and compiles the render, collision, and physics directory of a model in a single run. Just point it at the root of your model folder and go!

tool bulk-import-model-folder "objects\multi\world_node_a"
```

* source-directory - A local data path to the root of a model source directory.

## Bulk import models
Compile multiple source directories in a single run to generate a model tag and all the relevant tags involved.

```sh

tool bulk-import-models "objects\multi\jmi_Test.JMI"
```

* jmi-file - A local data path to where the JMI file is located.

## Bulk import scenery
Compile multiple source directories in a single run to generate a scenery tag and all the relevant tags involved.

```sh
#  bulk-import-scenery <jmi-file>
tool bulk-import-scenery "objects\multi\jmi_Test.JMI"
```

* jmi-file - A local data path to where the JMI file is located.

## Bulk import scenery folder
Generates a scenery tag and compiles the render, collision, and physics directory of a model in a single run. Just point it at the root of your model folder and go!

```sh
#  bulk-import-scenery-folder <source-directory>
tool bulk-import-scenery-folder "objects\multi\world_node_a"
```

* source-directory - A local data path to the root of a model source directory.

## Bulk physics

```sh
#  bulk-physics <jmi-file>
tool bulk-physics "objects\multi\jmi_Test.JMI"
```

* jmi-file - A local data path to where the JMI file is located.

## Bulk render

```sh
#  bulk-render <jmi-file>
tool bulk-render "objects\multi\jmi_Test.JMI"
```

* jmi-file - A local data path to where the JMI file is located.

# Camera track
This commands takes a JMA file directly and converts it to a [camera_track](~) for the game. The length of the animation should be at most 16 as that is the max number of control points a camera track tag can contain. The JMA should contain a skeleton made up of a single bone that will change its position each frame. The orientation of the bone will determine the position and rotation of the control point for that index. The name of the JMA file will be the name of the tag.

```sh
# camera-track <source-file>
tool camera-track cameras\ohno.JMA
```

* source-file - A local data path to where the JMA file is located.

# Collision
A [JMS](~) file containing a collision model can be compiled into a collision model tag

```sh
# collision <source-directory>
tool collision "objects\characters\masterchief"
```

* source-directory - A local data path to the root of a model source directory.

For the example above, Tool would expect to find a corresponding JMS file at `data\objects\characters\masterchief\collision\mc_collision.JMS`. Assuming no errors, it would be compiled into `tags\objects\characters\masterchief\masterchief.collision_model`. Geometry errors will cause Tool to create [WRL files](~wrl) for troubleshooting.

ui\hud\battle_rifle.new_hud_definition,battle_rifle.new_hud_definition.xml
```

# Export windows font
Given a system font, this verb generates `.tif` files for each of its glyphs within a subdirectory of `data`.

```sh
# export-windows-font <output-directory> <font-file-(optional)> <typeface-name> <point-size>
tool export-windows-font
tool export-windows-font example dummy "Arial Bold" 12
```

* output-directory - The name of the directory within `data` where tif files will be generated to. Tool expects that this directory and a subdirectory. called `exported` alread exist. For an argument of `example`, Tool would expect to find the directory `data\example\exported`.
* font-file-(optional) - While this argument is marked optional, it appears to be required to make the command work but is possibly unused. Use any string.
* typeface-name - The name of the system font to be exported, e.g. "Arial Bold".
* point-size - The font size to generate glyphs at.

# Extract collision data
Extracts import info from a [collision_model](~) tag to retrieve the original JMS used to create the tag. Don't expect this command to do anything if there is no import info.

```sh
# extract-collision-data <collision_model>
tool extract-collision-data "objects\characters\masterchief\masterchief"
```

* collision_model - A local tag path to a collision tag without file extension.

# Extract HS scripts

```

* name_substring - A local tag path to a directory containing scenario_hs_source_file tag files.

# Extract LPC data
Dumps a file called `test.aif` in the root of H2-EK. This is likely to be [linear predictive coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_predictive_coding) data for the sound file but this hasn't be verified.

```sh

# Extract unicode strings
Extract strings from [multilingual_unicode_string_list](~) and dumps the results back to a text file in data. Results may not match original source exactly so give the files a read to make sure tool won't have any issues.

```sh
# extract-unicode-strings <multilingual_unicode_string_list>
tool extract-unicode-strings "ui\hud\hud_messages"
```

* multilingual_unicode_string_list - A local tag path to a multilingual_unicode_string_list tag without extension.

# FBX to ASS
This command takes an FBX and converts it to an [ASS](~) file for Halo 2 level importing. Use this if you don't have access to an export script.

For some details on how to setup the FBX file see [FBX for H2](~fbx).

# FBX to JMA
This command takes an FBX and converts it to an animation source file for Halo 2 importing. Use this if you don't have access to an export script. Be aware that the extension can be any of the available extensions for animation importing. It does not specifically needs to be JMA. You can type JMO as the extension and the output is still valid.

```sh
# fbx-to-jma <fbx> <jma> [Start-frame] [Last-frame]
tool fbx-to-jma "E:\my_fbx_files\cyborg_dab.fbx" F:\cyborg_my_custom_anim.JMA
tool fbx-to-jma "E:\my_fbx_files\cyborg_dab.fbx" F:\cyborg_my_custom_anim.JMA 5 10
```

* fbx - An absolute filepath to a valid FBX file.
* jma - An absolute filepath that includes name and extension to write the output to.
* Start-frame - Sets the first frame index that the converter will start from. Use this if you want only a specific section of an animation from your FBX. This arg is optional so you can leave this and Last-frame out if you want the animation as is.
* Last-frame - Sets the last frame index that the converter will end on. Use this if you want only a specific section of an animation from your FBX. This arg is optional so you can leave this and Last-frame out if you want the animation as is.

For some details on how to setup the FBX file see [FBX for H2](~fbx).

# FBX to JMI
This command takes an FBX and converts it to a JMI source file for Halo 2 importing. Use this if you don't have access to an export script.

```sh

tool fbx-to-jms render "F:\dreamer.fbx" "F:\dreamer.JMS"
```

* render,collision,physics-or-all - Sets the type of geo this FBX is for. Use either render, collision, physics, or all only. The geo class set will determine what geometry gets exported from the JMS
* fbx - An absolute filepath to a valid FBX file.
* jms - An absolute filepath that includes name and extension to write the output to.

For some details on how to setup the FBX file see [FBX for H2](~fbx).

# Fix model materials
Sets global material names for model tags in a directory if the name is invalid.

tool fix-model-materials "incompetent" hey
```

* root-directory - A local tag path to a directory containing model tags.
* material-name - What to set the global material name to.

# Fix tags
Various command to fix up tags. Almost all of them are meant for porting Xbox to PC.

```sh
# fix-tags <action>
tool fix-tags count-scripts
```


* action - What action to take. Type something invalid like "help" to see a full list of options.

Most commands will not do anything but a few might be useful if you have a very specific issue.


# FP model animations
Import animation source files as a first person animation. Use this if you're making FP weapon animations.

```sh
# fp-model-animations <source-directory> <character-directory> <weapon-directory> [flags]
tool fp-model-animations "objects\characters\masterchief\fp\weapons\rifle\fp_smg" "objects\characters\masterchief\fp" "objects\weapons\rifle\smg\fp_smg"
```

* weapon-directory - A local data path to the root of the first person weapon model source directory the character is using.
* flags - ??? This is an optional arg.

The source files can have different extensions. That depends on the type of animation they are intended to be. See the page about [animation data](~animation-data) for information about the various extensions and the different types of animation.

Add [rename.txt](~rename-txt) to reuse animations as other animations, without copying and renaming files.

# Import damage table
Imports `data\globals\armor_vs_damage.csv` to update the damage table block in [globals](~). The CSV (which can be exported from any spreadsheet software like Excel) uses Damage Groups as the columns, and Armor Modifiers as the rows, with each cell being the applicable Damage Multiplier.

```sh
# import-damage-table
tool import-damage-table
```

# Import decorator set

```

* jmi-file - A local data path to a JMI file.

# Import particle set
Imports a JMI set to generate a particle tag.

```sh
# import-particle-model <jmi-file>
tool import-particle-model "objects\characters\brute\garbage\brute_helmet.JMI"
```

* jmi-file - A local data path to a JMI file.

# Baking lightmaps

H2 lightmaps are generally nicer than H1 lightmaps but can take longer to render if you are only using a single process. To mitigate this issue and allow more rapid iteration Halo 2 featured a primitive version of the lightmap farm that later games utilised. This allowed the most time consuming part of lightmapping to be farmed out to multiple servers. In Halo 2 only one step is shared so running `n` instances doesn't quite divide the time taken by `n`.

## Single instance Lightmaps
Run a lightmap instance. No fuss no muss.

```sh
# lightmaps <scenario> <bsp-name> <quality-setting>
tool lightmaps "scenarios\multi\halo\coagulation\coagulation" "coagulation" direct_only
```

* scenario - A local tag path to a scenario tag without extension.
* bsp-name - The name of a scenario_structure_bsp tag without extension and belongs to the referenced scenario.
* quality-setting - Standard Halo 2 light quality string. The list of options is as follows.
	* checkerboard
	* cuban
	* draft_low
	* draft_medium
	* draft_high
	* draft_super
	* direct_only
	* low
	* medium
	* high
	* super

### Lightmaps debug
A command to debug lightmaps. Debug them how you ask? That's an excellent question! Lets move on to the next command.

```sh
# lightmaps-debug <scenario> <bsp-name> <quality-setting> <begin-light-index> <end-light-index>
tool lightmaps-debug "scenarios\multi\halo\coagulation\coagulation" "coagulation" direct_only 0 1
```

* scenario - A local tag path to a scenario tag without extension.
* bsp-name - The name of a scenario_structure_bsp tag without extension and belongs to the referenced scenario.
* quality-setting - Standard Halo 2 light quality string. The list of options is as follows.
	* checkerboard
	* cuban
	* draft_low
	* draft_medium
	* draft_high
	* draft_super
	* direct_only
	* low
	* medium
	* high
	* super
* begin-light-index - ???
* end-light-index - ???

## Multi-instance lightmaps

Multi instance lightmaps were intended to run on the lightmap farm, some changes were made during the development of the H2-EK to fix issues related to that but this didn't fix all of them. Overall they are a good alternative to single instance lightmaps as long as you are careful.
If you are using a launcher such as [Osoyoos](~) this should be handled for you automatically.

### Lightmap worker

{% alert type="danger" %}
Launch worker with the index `0` last (and preferably ~30-60 seconds after the other ones) or the other workers will overwrite certain data needed for functional lightmaps.
If this data gets overwritten scenery objects will not get lit correctly and will be pitch black.
{% /alert %}

Run a lightmap-worker instance to cut down on time spent lighting. Make sure to run [`lightmaps-farm-merge`](~h2-tool#lightmap-merge) afterwards to complete the process.

```sh
# lightmaps-farm-worker <scenario> <bsp-name> <quality-setting> <worker-index> <worker-count>
tool lightmaps-farm-worker "scenarios\multi\halo\coagulation\coagulation" "coagulation" direct_only 0 3
```

* scenario - A local tag path to a scenario tag without extension.
* bsp-name - The name of a scenario_structure_bsp tag without extension and belongs to the referenced scenario.
* quality-setting - Standard Halo 2 light quality string. The list of options is as follows.
	* checkerboard
	* cuban
	* draft_low
	* draft_medium
	* draft_high
	* draft_super
	* direct_only
	* low
	* medium
	* high
	* super
* worker-index - The instance ID starting from 0. The range for this depends on the number set for worker-count.
* worker-count - The number of instances that will be launched.

### Lightmap merge

Merge the results from [`lightmaps-farm-worker`](~h2-tool#lightmap-worker) to form the final lightmap bitmap tag.

```sh
# lightmaps-farm-merge <scenario> <bsp-name> <worker-count>
tool lightmaps-farm-merge "scenarios\multi\halo\coagulation\coagulation" "coagulation" 2
```

* scenario - A local tag path to a scenario tag without extension.
* bsp-name - The name of a scenario_structure_bsp tag without extension and belongs to the referenced scenario.
* worker-count - The number of `lightmaps-farm-worker` instances that were used.

## Quality levels
Tool supports a few different quality levels, for testing geometry you will want to use `direct_only` if you want to test lighting you will want to use at least `draft_low` as bounced light will change how a lot of things look. The highest quality - `super` - only needs to be used as a final pass, it will take a long time even with a fast CPU and multiple instances. Modding tool to increase these settings is possible but `super` is close to the limit of how good lighting generated by tool can be and improvements from increasing these settings beyond that are minor.

{% alert %}
The "cuban" quality setting is likely named after the nickname of one of the engineers that worked on the lightmapping process.

Structure compilation converts the raw polygon and materials data from the ASS into data structures which are more efficient for Halo to use during rendering, collision tests, and AI pathfinding among other tasks. Note that [lightmaps](~scenario_structure_lightmap) are **not** produced during this step, but rather with the [lightmaps verb](#baking-lightmaps).

Multiple ASS files can be placed in a level's `structure` directory for multiple BSPs (used for large singleplayer levels). Each ASS will be compiled into a separate structure BSP and added to the scenario. Scripts and trigger volumes can then be used to switch between the BSPs.

# Structure new verbose from ASS
A [ASS](~) file containing level geometry can be compiled into a [scenario_structure_bsp](~) tag. This version of the structure command gives verbose output.
