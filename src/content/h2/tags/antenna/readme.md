The **antenna** tag is essentially the same as its [Halo 1 counterpart](~h1/tags/antenna). It is used to display a simple springy antenna attached to object markers, such as on the Warthog.

Antennas on the Mongoose and Warthog can be seen in earlier development screenshots and renders of Halo 2, but never ended up in retail Halo 2 despite the tags being set up for it. As of December 2022, antennas now render correctly in Halo 2 MCC.
