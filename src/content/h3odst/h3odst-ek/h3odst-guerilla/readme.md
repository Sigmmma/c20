**H3 ODST Guerilla** (`guerilla.exe`) is part of the [Halo 3 ODST Editing Kit](~h3odst-ek), is a visual [tag](~tags) editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps](~bitmap) and is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer ingame previews or interactive placement of [objects](~object), which is [Sapien's](~H3ODST-Sapien) role.

It's pretty much identical to [Halo 3 Guerilla](~H3-Guerilla) so please refer to that page for further info on hotkeys and features.
