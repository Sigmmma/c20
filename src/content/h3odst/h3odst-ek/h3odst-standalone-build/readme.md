The [Halo 3 ODST Editing Kit](~H3ODST-EK) includes a **standalone build** of that game (**atlas_tag_test.exe**). This build doesn't include network functionality and it intended for testing single-player maps. It includes AI debugging code not included in other published builds of the engine.

{% alert type="danger" %}
The standalone build is configured differently from the retail build of Halo 3 ODST that's part of MCC - bugs or features found in one might not be found in the other. For that reason maps should always receive final testing as [map cache files](~map) loaded by MCC itself.
{% /alert %}

It's pretty much identical to [Halo 3 Standalone](~H3-Standalone-build) so please refer to that page for further info on hotkeys and features.
