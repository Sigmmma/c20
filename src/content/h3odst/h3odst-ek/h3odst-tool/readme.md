**Halo 3 ODST Tool** (**tool.exe**), is a [command-line](~) utility used to compile data into [tags](~), and tags into [maps](~map). It was released as a part of the [Halo 3 ODST Editing Kit](~h3odst-ek) by 343 Industries in 2022.

It's pretty much identical to [Halo 3 Tool](~H3-Tool) so please refer to that page for further info on hotkeys and features.
