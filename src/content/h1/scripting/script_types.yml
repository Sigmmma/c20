script_types:
  - type: continuous
    info:
      en: Runs every tick (simulation frame of the engine), at 30 ticks per second.
      es:
    ex: >-
      (script continuous kill_players_in_zone
        (if (volume_test_object kill_volume (list_get (players) 0))
          (unit_kill (unit (list_get (players) 0)))
        )
        (if (volume_test_object kill_volume (list_get (players) 1))
          (unit_kill (unit (list_get (players) 1)))
        )
      )

  - type: dormant
    info:
      en: >
        Sleeps until started with `wake`, runs until there are no instructions
        left, then stops. Calling `wake` a second time will not restart the
        script.
      es:
    ex: >-
      (script dormant save_valley_canyon
        (sleep_until (= 0 (ai_living_count valley_canyon)) 10)
        (game_save_no_timeout)
      )

  - type: startup
    info:
      en: >
        Begins executing when the level initially loads and would be used for
        setting up AI alliances, running intro cinematics, and orchestrating the
        overall mission structure. You can have multiple startup scripts in the
        scenario.
      es:
    ex: >-
      (script startup mission_a30
        (hud_show_motion_sensor false)
        (fade_out 0 0 0 0)
        (print "mission script is running")
        (ai_allegiance player human)
        ;...
      )

  - type: static
    info:
      en: >
        Performed when called from another script. In H1A these can support up
        to 16 parameters like later games.
      es:
    ex: |-
      ; without parameters, call like (player0)
      (script static "unit" player0
        (unit (list_get (players) 0))
      )
      ; with parameters (H1A only), call like (my_add 1 2)
      (script static short (my_add (short x) (short y))
        (+ x y)
      )
  - type: stub
    info:
      en: |
        A `stub` script by itself does nothing. It allows you to pre-declare a
        `static` script without providing a script body.
        This allows other scripts to invoke a `static` script without the full
        function body being declared yet.
        
        The script you override a `stub` with must have the same "signature"
        (i.e. name, parameters, and return type). A stub cannot be declared more
        than once. The full implementation of a `stub` *may* be placed in
        another script file.

        If you're familiar with C function prototypes, this is very similar.
      es:
    ex: (script stub object player0)
