      You are running out of memory. Try freeing up more physical memory on your system, and/or using a [large address aware Sapien](#limits).

      This is probably not an issue with your tags, but rather Sapien failing to
      initialize its sound system (perhaps after device changes or system sleep).
      Restart your system or put `sound_enable 0` into Sapien's `editor_init.txt`
      if you don't need to hear sounds in Sapien for now.

      You have a [bitmap][] tag which is too large. Do not exceed dimensions of 2048 pixels because support is GPU-dependent; technically DirectX 9 did not allow sizes over this limit. This issue is fixed in [H1A Sapien][h1a-sapien] as it updated to DX11 which doesn't have this issue.

      A [detail object][detail_object_collection] was painted outside the map. Be careful when painting around corners and small spaces, and save frequently.

      This may be caused by a multi-core processor. Try running in Windows 98 compatibility mode, or setting the process affinity to a single core using Task Manager before opening the scenario. This issue is fixed in [H1A Sapien][h1a-sapien].

      An [object][] has _transparent self occlusion_ enabled while also referencing a transparent [shader][] with _extra layers_. This is not a problem in-game. This issue is fixed in [H1A Sapien][h1a-sapien].

      Your map uses a transparent shader with no maps defined. Add at least 1.
