      This is probably not an issue with your tags, but rather Sapien failing to
      initialize its sound system (perhaps after device changes or system sleep).
      Restart your system or put `sound_enable 0` into Sapien's `editor_init.txt`
      if you don't need to hear sounds in Sapien for now.
