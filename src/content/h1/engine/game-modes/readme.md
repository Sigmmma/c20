There are 5 base **game modes**, also called "game engines", which implement multiplayer game rules and scoring:

| Engine           | `game_variant` names
|------------------|--------------------
| King             | `king`, `team_king`, `crazy_king`, `classic_king`, `classic_king_pro`, `classic_crazy_king`, `classic_team_king`
| Oddball          | `oddball`, `team_oddball`, `classic_oddball`, `classic_team_oddball`, `classic_reverse_tag`, `classic_accumulation`, `juggernaut`, `classic_juggernaut`, `classic_stalker`
| Race             | `race`, `classic_race`, `classic_rally`, `classic_team_race`, `classic_team_rally`, `team_race`
| Slayer           | `slayer`, `team_slayer`, `classic_slayer`, `classic_slayer_pro`, `classic_phantoms`, `classic_endurance`, `classic_rockets`, `classic_snipers`, `classic_team_slayer`
| CTF              | `ctf`, `assault`, `classic_ctf`, `classic_ctf_pro`, `classic_invasion`, `classic_iron_ctf`, 

All gametypes are customizations of these base modes. To test game modes in [Standalone](~h1-standalone-build), use one of the names above with the [game_variant](~scripting#functions-game-variant) function:

```console
game_variant ctf
map_name levels\test\bloodgulch\bloodgulch
```

The game mode will be active for all subsequent uses of `map_name`. If you have previously set a game variant and want to return to singleplayer, use `game_variant none` before loading a scenario.

Objectives like the CTF flags, oddball spawns, and hill boundaries depend on [scenario netgame flags](~scenario#tag-field-netgame-flags) placed using [Sapien](~h1-sapien).

The UI localizations for these game variants are found in `ui\default_multiplayer_game_setting_names.unicode_string_list`.

# CTF
The CTF engine is responsible for controlling CTF and Assault games.

During initialization of a CTF game, all player spawn points are validated. If a spawn point is closer to the enemy team's flag than its own team's flag (or vice versa for Assault), its team index is set to `3` which prevents it from being used. If a level artist accidentally places the CTF flags in the wrong bases it can result in all spawn points being disabled and players being forever stuck ["waiting for space to clear"](~player-spawns#troubleshooting-waiting-for-space-to-clear) rather than spawning.
