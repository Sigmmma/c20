**invader-bitmap** is a [command-line](~) tool included in the [Invader](~) project. It generates [bitmap](~) tags from sources images, similar to the [Tool bitmap verb](~h1-tool#bitmap) but with better compressed bitmap quality and fewer quirks.

The reverse workflow of this tool is implemented in [invader-recover](~).

# Usage
