* Edits regular [tags](~h1/tags), [OpenSauce](~) tags, and gametypes
* Loads corrupt tags and view/edit hidden data
* Export/imports [blocks](~h1/tags#blocks)
* Edits tags safely with backups and undo functionality
* Contains a hierarchy view for easily browsing a tags directory
* Switches between multiple tag directories
* Scans for broken tag dependencies and displays tag dependencies
* Displays, validates, and archives tag dependencies
