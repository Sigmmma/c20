The **Mozz Editing Kit**, previously called the **Moses Editing Kit** or **Mo's Editing Kit** (MEK), is an [open source][mek-repo] and cross-platform Python-based toolset which offers alternatives to and supplements the tools of the [HEK](~custom-edition#halo-editing-kit). 

Being pre-MCC, it only supports Custom Edition and should not be used with MCC tags. However, unlike [invader](~) it does support [OpenSauce tags](~opensauce#new-tag-groups).

The MEK is still used for some of its unique features:
* [Map deprotection](~map#protected-maps).
* Exporting and importing [tag blocks](~tags#blocks), saving time when copying data across tags.

{% alert type="danger" %}
The MEK project unmaintained and has known issues. Consider using alternatives like [Invader](~) and the updated [H1A-EK](~) for MCC.
{% /alert %}

# Refinery
Refinery is a [tag](~tags) and [source data](~source-data) extractor. See the [Refinery](~refinery) page for more information.

# Mozzarilla
Mozzarilla is general tag editor serving the same role as Guerilla, but with extra features. See the [Mozzarilla](~mozzarilla) page for more information.

# Other tools
The MEK includes a `tools_misc` folder with miscellaneous scripts. One of these is the [wrl-to-obj-converter](~).
