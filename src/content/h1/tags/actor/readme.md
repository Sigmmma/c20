**Actor** definitions configure core AI behaviours, including which decisions they make and how, irrespective of the character's appearance or rank-specific alterations (which is what [actor_variant](~) is for).

# Actor type definitions
There are 16 [actor types](#tag-field-type). Each actor type maps to one of 13 unique _actor type definitions_ which are hardcoded and contain a combination of basic settings and references to game code implementing the particular behaviours of that actor type. Some actor types use the same definition, like monitor and sentinel.

Each actor type definition has a unique way to decide on [one of 14 actions](~ai#actions). It is difficult to understand how exactly each actor type definition differs without extensive testing and/or reverse engineering. It's known that there is a lot of similarity between their code, but that Flood units are the most unique.
