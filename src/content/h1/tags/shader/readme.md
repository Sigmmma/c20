Shader tags define the visual appearance of models in the game world. The _shader_ tag class itself is abstract and cannot be created directly, but is extended by the various child shader types like [shader_model](~) and [shader_environment](~).

# Structure and fields

{% tagStruct "h1/shader" /%}
