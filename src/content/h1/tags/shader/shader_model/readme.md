The **shader_model** tag is used for opaque materials on [object models](~gbxmodel). It supports features like map animation, detail maps, specularity, self-illumination, and color change (e.g. for armour ranks/teams).

Singleplayer units have their colors set in their [actor_variant](~) tags. In multiplayer, players' armor colors are [hard-coded](~hard-coded-data#multiplayer-armor-colors).

# Base map

The _base map_ controls the diffuse color and transparency of the shader. The **RGB** diffuse color is multiplied with the color change source if used, masked by the multipurpose map's color change mask. The base map's **alpha** channel is a transparency mask.

# Multipurpose map
The _multipurpose map_ is an optional bitmap whose individual channels provide greyscale masks for color change, reflections, self illumination, and detail maps (a technique called _channel packing_). The purpose of each channel depends on the game version:

## Gearbox

When Gearbox ported Halo to PC, the channels were reordered for an unknown reason. This is also true for all Gearbox-derived ports like H1A unless the [OG Xbox channel order flag](#tag-field-shader-model-flags-multipurpose-map-uses-og-xbox-channel-order) is set. Because of this change in shader behaviour, multipurpose map tags differ between H1X and Gearbox.

{% alert type="danger" %}
If you're using the [legacy HEK](~custom-edition#halo-editing-kit) and H1CE, don't pay attention to Guerilla's channel usage description when editing this tag. It describes Xbox channel order only which is incorrect. In [H1A Guerilla](~h1-guerilla) the channel order is corrected described.
{% /alert %}

* **Red:** is an auxiliary mask. It can mask the [detail map](#tag-field-detail-mask) if the [detail mask](#tag-field-detail-mask) is set to _multipurpose map alpha_. Despite the option saying "alpha" in Guerilla it really means the red channel in this context.
* **Green:** Masks self-illumination, used for lights on the model. The self-illumination is added to diffuse light and _then_ multiplied with diffuse color, rather than being added _after_. This means pure black areas of the diffuse map cannot have self-illumination.
* **Blue:** Masks [cube map specular reflections](#tag-field-reflection-cube-map). Pure blue is highest specularity, while black is none.
* **Alpha:** Masks color change, such as for armour ranks/teams. Color sources include the [actor_variant](~actor_variant#change-colors), [multiplayer colors](~hard-coded-data#multiplayer-armor-colors), and [object](~object#tag-field-change-colors).

It is a common misconception that multipurpose maps need to be purple due to some stock tags having an identical red and blue channel. However, it is not necessary to have any red channel information if you do not require detail map masking or [another channel](#tag-field-detail-mask) can serve as the detail map mask.

## Xbox
Channel order is different on the classic Xbox version of the game. Guerilla correctly describes multipurpose maps extracted from Xbox maps:

* **Red:** Specular reflection mask (modulates reflections)
* **Green:** Self-illumination mask (adds to diffuse light)
* **Blue:** Primary change-color mask (recolors diffuse map)
* **Alpha:** Auxiliary mask

The _change color_ feature allows parts of the shader to be recolored at runtime for random variation and different ranks without requiring a different bitmap for each color.

The color from the [_change color source_](#tag-field-change-color-source) gets multiplied against the base map, using the color change mask from the multipurpose map. The channel of the mask depends on the channel order (Gearbox vs Xbox).

Change color sources originate from either the object tag's [_change colors_ block](~object#tag-field-change-colors) or are overriden by [actor_variant colors](~actor_variant#change-colors). They can also come from hard-coded [multiplayer armor colors](~hard-coded-data#multiplayer-armor-colors).
