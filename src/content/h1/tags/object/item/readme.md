**Items** are simple moveable objects and the parent tag of [weapon](~), [garbage](~), and [equipment](~). Although they can have a hitbox in the form of a [model_collision_geometry](~), when moving they are simulated as simple point-like objects that can bounce off the [BSP](~scenario_structure_bsp) and non-item objects. Unlike [units](~unit), they cannot be controlled or die (though they can despawn).
