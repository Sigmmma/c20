**Vehicles** are a type of [unit](~) which can be driven by [bipeds](~biped). They are dynamic objects with mass-point [physics](~). While most examples of vehicles are fairly obvious, some more esoteric ones include the cryopods in a10, lifepods and longswords despite only being used in cinematics, and even the Halo ring seen outside the autumn's bridge.
