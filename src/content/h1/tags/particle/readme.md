The particle tag defines the characteristics of point-like entities used extensively throughout Halo's effects to simulate sparks, smoke, plasma, blood, and more. Particles can interact with [wind](~), [collision geometry](~model_collision_geometry) and the [BSP](~scenario_structure_bsp) via their [point_physics](~).
