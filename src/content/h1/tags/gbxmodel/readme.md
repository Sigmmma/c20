The Gearbox model tag contains the marker points and render models for [objects](~object) such as [vehicles](~vehicle), [scenery](~), and [weapons](~weapon) among others. It is not collideable nor animated on its own, and objects may reference additional [model_collision_geometry](~) and [model_animations](~) tags. This tag supports LODs and permutations, and includes [shader_model](~) references.

Don't confuse this tag with the Xbox-only [model](~). Gearbox Software created this tag class for the PC port, and it is therefore used in all [derivatives](~h1) of that port, like Mac, Demo, and MCC. Unlike [model](~), this tag uses uncompressed vertices.

# Shaders
Each [part](#tag-field-geometries-parts) of a model can reference a different [shader](~), like the Warthog's windscreen using a [shader_transparent_glass](~) while its body uses a [shader_model](~). While a model can _technically_ reference any kind of shader, referencing a [shader_environment](~) is **not recommended** when targeting H1CE because it [renders incorrectly](~renderer#gearbox-regressions) in atmospheric fog.

# Nodes
Nodes can be thought of as the model's "skeleton" and can be animated to move parts of the model. Each vertex can be influenced by up to 2 nodes. H1A and H1CE 1.10 allow up to 63 model nodes. Older versions of H1CE and H1X allow 48.

# Markers
Markers are simple named points with orientation attached to a model. Since they are parented by nodes, they can be animated. Markers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as attaching objects together with scripts (e.g. Pelicans carrying Warthogs), attaching widgets like [antenna](~), or firing [projectiles](~projectile) from in the case of weapons. You can view object markers with `render_model_markers 1`.

This tag only contains the marker data but other tags usually determine how they are used. However, certain marker names have special behaviour in-engine:

* `head`:
  * Determines where AI look at when scripted to talk to another character.
  * Base location for the friendly indicator in multiplayer.
  * Used as a ray origin when testing if AI can see their enemy.
* `primary trigger`: Where a weapon's primary trigger projectiles and effects come from. See also the [_projectiles use weapon origin_ field](~weapon#tag-field-triggers-flags-projectiles-use-weapon-origin).
* `secondary trigger`: As above, for secondary triggers (second trigger slot).
* `body`
* `front`: Possibly used to used to see if you're facing a [device_control](~), if present.
* `ground point`: Determines the resting point for [items](~item).
* `left hand`: Used during the grenade throwing animation.
* `melee`: Where melee damage comes from here. If not present, the engine picks an unknown default location.
* `hover thrusters`:
  * When used on a vehicle with "alien scout" or "alien fighter" [vehicle physics type](~vehicle#tag-field-vehicle-type), spawns [an effect](~vehicle#tag-field-effect) when the vehicle is hovering close to the ground. This can be seen at a piloted Banshee's wingtips when sitting on the ground.
  * When the vehicle physics type is "human plane", creates a similar dust effect if the marker is pointed at nearby ground. Used for the Pelican's thrusters.
* `jet thrusters`: Can also be used for vehicles with "human plane" physics to create the Pelican's thruster dust effect.

Commonly used marker names without hard-coded behaviour include:

* `primary ejection`: Used to indicate where casings fly out when firing the primary trigger.

[Tool](~h1-tool#model) only includes markers from the `superhigh` LOD.

# Regions
Regions are named sections of the model which can have multiple [permutations](#permutations). Region names are used by the engine to relate parts of the render model with the [collision model](~model_collision_geometry). For example, a Flood combat form losing an arm. Some regions have special behaviour in-engine:

* `head`: Sets headshot areas for [damage_effect](~).

Regions render in the order they are stored in the tag. When naming regions, consider that they will be sorted by name when compiled into the `.gbxmodel`. This can be important for [skyboxes](~skyboxes#regions) and objects with multiple layers of alpha-blended transparent shaders which aren't [z-culled][z-buf] and need a correct sorting order to be explicitly defined, assuming the object is viewed mostly from one direction.

# Permutations
A permutation is a variation of a [region](#regions) that can be randomly selected. They are often used to give [bipeds](~biped) visual variety. Some permutations have special behaviour in-engine:

* `~blur`: Switched to depending on [weapon rate of fire](~weapon#tag-field-triggers-blurred-rate-of-fire) and [vehicle speed](~vehicle#tag-field-blur-speed) to fake motion blur. Used for the Warthog tires and chaingun when spinning fast enough.
* `~damaged`: Switched to depending how much damage the object takes based on [Damage Threshold](~model_collision_geometry#tag-field-regions-damage-threshold)

Permutations can also be set via [script](~scripting#functions-object-set-permutation) or the [Desired Permutation](~scenario#tag-field-scenery-desired-permutation) field when placing objects in a Scenario.
In order to use the Desired Permutation field the model's permutations must be named in a specific way: `Permutation_name-###`

Randomly selected permutations are not [network synchronized](~netcode).

# Level of detail
{% figure src="lod.jpg" %}
Low quality LODs shown for the Chief biped and Warthog. Note the reduced geometric detail.
{% /figure %}

Models can contain multiple levels of detail (LODs), ranging from simplified meshes with reduced shader count to high detail meshes with numerous complex shaders. The game will select a LOD based on the on-screen diameter of the object's [bounding sphere](~object#tag-field-bounding-radius) in pixels and this tag's [LOD cutoffs](#tag-field-super-high-detail-cutoff). Objects which are very distant or small don't need a lot of geometric detail, so they can be rendered using low quality LODs to keep the framerate high in busy scenes.

Halo CE supports 5 LODs. From best to worst quality:

* super high
* high
* medium
* low
* super low

When rendering first person models, Halo always uses the lowest quality LOD instead of the highest. When creating FP arms or weapons create a separate FP model from your 3P model which only includes a single super high LOD.

LODs are created by using [a special naming convention](~h1-tool#model) when compiling models with Tool.

{% alert type="danger" %}
LODs are currently not behaving as expected in Halo CE, both in tools and in the Master Chief Collection. This can cause only the super high LOD to be visible at all times, no matter the on-screen diameter of an object's [bounding sphere](~object#tag-field-bounding-radius).
