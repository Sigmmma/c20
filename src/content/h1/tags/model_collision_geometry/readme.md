Model collision geometry tags contain collision data for an [object](~). This is in contrast to [model/gbxmodel](~gbxmodel) tags, which mostly contain the renderable data. Collision meshes tend to be less detailed than render meshes, and are used to check collisions _within_ the object's [bounding radius](~object#tag-field-bounding-radius).

Beyond having a collision mesh, these tags can also contain:

* _Pathfinding spheres_ which prevent AI from trying to walk through the object
* Damage ratios for each part of the object (e.g. weak points)
* Shield and health values

Collision geometry, rather than the [model](~gbxmodel), is used to cast [scenery](~) shadows in [lightmaps](~scenario_structure_bsp#lightmaps).

# Pathfinding spheres

AI can figure out where to go by checking the pathfinding data on the [BSP](~scenario_structure_bsp). However, since objects like [scenery](~) and [units](~unit) are not part of the BSP, Bungie implemented _pathfinding spheres_: spherical markers on objects that AI actively avoid walking into.

By placing these spheres in an object's collision model, artists can tell the AI exactly where _not_ to go. As far as we know, all object types can make use of pathfinding spheres. The object's bounding sphere does not seem to affect AI avoidance of them.

## How to add them
Pathfinding spheres are imported from the collision [JMS](~) file of your object. They are marked with `#pathfinder` and their radius is the actual radius that the AI will avoid walking in relation to the mid-point.

Pathfinding spheres can also be created automatically in some cases:

* When an artist doesn't specify any pathfinding spheres, the game will assume one at the object's origin at half the size of the [bounding sphere](~object#tag-field-bounding-radius) (which can be either too small or too big and result in bad pathfinding).
* Vehicle mass points (see [physics](~)) also count as pathfinding spheres. AI will actively avoid these.
* [Bipeds](~biped) by default also have a pathfinding sphere around their feet with the same width as their physics pill.

# Limits
model_collision_geometry tags can only have up to 32 pathfinding spheres in legacy (256 in H1A), up to 8 regions, and up to 33 permutations to a region.

# Animation
Unlike [BSPs](~scenario_structure_bsp), collision geometry can have a self-intersecting mesh. However, this is only permitted between meshes parented by different nodes (e.g. limbs of a biped intersecting each other or the torso). Collision geometry cannot have weighted skinning for animations, so rigidly follows parent nodes in animations.

# Phantom BSP

{% figure src="phantom.jpg" %}
Phantom BSP exists in the collision model of covenant crates.
{% /figure %}

Although phantom BSP is typically seen in the context of level geometry, it can also affect model collision geometry because this tag uses the same collision data structures as a [scenario_structure_bsp](~scenario_structure_bsp#phantom-bsp). In the case of models, phantom BSP is limited to the object's bounding radius.

Like with level geometry, these can be troubleshooted in [Sapien](~h1-sapien) by running the console commands:

```console
collision_debug 1
collision_debug_phantom_bsp 1
```

To fix them, use similar tricks as fixing level phantom BSP: fixing cases of nearly co-planar faces reported in your [WRL file](~wrl) and/or slightly altering the collision model around the problematic location. If changes to the source geometry do not resolve the phantom BSP, you can use [H1A Tool](~h1-tool) with the `fix-phantom-bsp` option enabled to compile the collision.
