**Point physics** control how [particles](~particle), [particle systems](~particle_system), [weather](~weather_particle_system), [flags](~flag), [contrails](~contrail), and [antenna](~) interact with the environment. This includes wind, water, density, and collisions with the [BSP](~scenario_structure_bsp). Essentially anything that can be suspended in the atmosphere or water is simulated this way.
