This page will serve as the hub for level creation guides. While some of these guides are intended for Blender users, some pages may still be useful to the end user regardless of the 3D software being used.

# Understanding the data directory
[Data directory](~file-directories)

In this section we will be covering how to setup proper folder structures for our assets in the HEK data folder. This section does not cater to a specific 3D software and can be read by anyone.

[Level creation - Beginner](~beginner)

The next section will cover the common settings you should mess with when working in Blender. If you already have a solid grasp of what you should configure in Blender then go ahead and skip this section.

The next section will show the user how to create a simple box level that can be imported in Halo to make a valid level. Skip this section if you already have a solid grasp on modeling and setting up a valid scene for Halo or are using the example level file provided in the [beginner](~beginner) section.

## Level creation - Advanced
[Level creation - Advanced](~advanced)

The next section will add details to our previously created mesh in the [Level creation - Beginner](~beginner) section. Do not read this section without reviewing the material in the [Level creation - Beginner](~beginner) section. Skip this section if you already have a solid grasp on modeling and setting up a valid scene for Halo or are using the example level file provided in the [beginner](~beginner) section.

## Level creation - Exporting

This next section will cover how to export a properly made mesh from Blender using the [Halo Asset Blender Development Toolset.](~halo-asset-blender-development-toolset) Be sure to review the material in the [Level creation - Beginner](~beginner) and [Level creation - Advanced](~advanced) sections or have the example level file provided in [beginner](~beginner) at the ready.
