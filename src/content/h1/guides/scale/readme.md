# Halo's unit types
* **JMS units** are those used in model tag data. They match 1:1 with the default [3ds max](~3dsmax) units and the units in [JMS files](~JMS).
* **World units** are equal to 100 JMS units. They are often seen in [Guerilla](~) and are the coordinates seen when placing objects in [Sapien](~).
