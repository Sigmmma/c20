**Halo Online** is a canceled installment of the Halo game series and runs on a modified [Halo 3][h3] Engine. It was created by [Saber Interactive][saber] and initially released as part of a closed beta in Russia on the PC in 2015-16.

Like other games in the series Halo Online uses 343 Industries proprietary [Blam!][engine] and is powered by a highly modified version of the Halo 3 engine, optimized for smooth performance on lower-end PCs.

## Eldewrito to MCC: A Legacy (PC, 343 Industries, 2016-Current day)
During the Halo Online closed testing, a group of modders were able to mod the game and began to work on "ElDewrito", a fan-attempt to bring the classic Halo experience to the PC platform by modding the game to play like the original release of Halo 3.

In April 2018, version 0.6 of the mod released to widespread community acclaim, reaching 12,000 concurrent players. Four days following the release of ElDewrito 0.6, the members of the team were contacted by 343 Industries including Frank O'Connor, whereupon they were asked to pause development of the mod  - however the modding team was not given an official cease and desist or DMCA takedown.

An official statement was given by 343 Industries the same day, explaining that the mod was taken down due to legal requirements to protect Microsoft intellectual property.

On December 15, 2020, it was revealed MCC Season 5: Anvil would include twelve armor permutations that originally came from Halo Online, such as Demo, Suture, and Compass Mjolnir armors.

## PC (Saber Interactive, April 2015)
This is the first release of Halo Online for PC.

### Modding
There are several tools and mods for the base game or external programs that users can grab to enhance their experience. Examples include:

* [Assembly][assembly] - A cache editing tool for various titles in the Halo series. Users can use this tool to make permanent edits to cache files and poke changes in real time. While not traditional workflow for map creation, it is a powerful tool that can be used to create interesting experiences. 

* [TagTool][tagtool] - A cache editing tool designed to allow *porting* of tag data between different versions and builds of the Blam engine, as well as importing brand new content.

Like all Halo games [tags][] play a large role in modding.
